[Reference spec](http://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202654-pseudocode-guide.pdf) that this is based off and many similar specifications exist across school systems all over the world. Implements partial specification but not the full amount.

## Extending

* shell script or another script to have a one command to run a psudocode file
